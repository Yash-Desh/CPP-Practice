1. A template does the same thing to a class, what a class does to the objects. 

2. It parametrizes the data type hence making it easy for us to use different classes without having to write 
   the whole thing again and again, violating the DRY rule. 

3. Templates furthermore give our program a generic view, where declaring one template suffices the task.

4. This program was all about creating a class and an embedded function to calculate the dot product of two "integer" 
   vectors.
   This program would obviously fail to calculate the dot products for some different data types. It would 
   demand an entirely different class. 
   But weâ€™ll save ourselves the effort and the time by declaring a template.
