##############################################Extra Notes#####################################################s

1. A destructor is a type of function which is called when the object is destroyed. 

2. Destructor never takes an argument nor does it return any value.

3. For statically created objects the destructor is automatically called 

4. For dynamically created objects the destructor has to be called manually
